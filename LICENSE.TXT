Communications explicitly stated in writing as "Not a contribution" will not be considered as a contribution. When providing a contribution to the build, the Contributor grants the Company a simple, free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license for the entire duration of the Contributor's rights to the contribution as provided by the legislation of the state-jurisdiction of the Contributor and/or international legislation for certain forms of contribution.

of the Build on the Licensee's computer for non-commercial use for its intended purpose (providing access to Players and the Game process).
